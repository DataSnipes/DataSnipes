# Current Project.

ShimBootWindows: The ShimBoot Chromebook Windows Distribution For Dedede Systems.

### How It Works

Its Not Really Running A Windows Distribution! Its Linux! Using Wine We Can Get It To Run EXE Files! And Because Linux Is Open Source We Can Disguise The Distro As Windows 11!

Version: 1.0.0 Debian mask (arm64)

DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS WITH OTHER DISTROS, IT WILL KILL THE CHROMEBOOK.
